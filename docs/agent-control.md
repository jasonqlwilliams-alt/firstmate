# Agent lifecycle control plane

Firstmate talks to a running agent two ways, and they are not the same channel.

The **data plane** is [`bin/fm-send.sh`](../bin/fm-send.sh): conversational text for the agent to read.
For a `kind=secondmate` target it always prepends the from-firstmate routing marker, because a secondmate is itself a firstmate and its reply must come back through the status path rather than a chat nobody reads.

The **control plane** is [`bin/fm-control.sh`](../bin/fm-control.sh): allowlisted lifecycle verbs addressed to an exact task id.

The split exists because the data plane's marking is exactly right for a message and exactly wrong for a lifecycle command.
A routing-marked `/quit` arrives as ordinary chat - `[fm-from-firstmate] /quit` - which the agent reasons about instead of executing.
The failure repeated across harnesses and homes, and the workaround (remember to use an unmarked send for agent-control commands, and improvise the right key or command per harness) lived only in agent prose, so it failed again every time a session did not happen to recall it.

## What the control plane owns

`bin/fm-control-lib.sh` owns three capability tables alongside per-harness wiring paths and read-only retirement validation; sourcing it has no side effects:

- The **verb allowlist**: `interrupt`, `exit`, `relaunch`.
  There is no arbitrary-text and no generic raw-key entry point.
  A caller either names an allowlisted verb or is refused.
- **Per-harness mechanics**: the key that cancels a running turn, how many times it must be delivered, whether the composer needs clearing afterwards, the command that exits the agent, and which task kinds the adapter is verified to run.
  These were previously carried only in the [`harness-adapters`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md) skill's tool references, which now point here.
  `bin/fm-send.sh`'s `--key` path reads the composer-clear table from this owner too, rather than keeping a second copy of it.
- **Per-backend capability**: which named keys a runtime backend can deliver, and whether it has a recovery-grade agent-state classifier able to prove an agent stopped.

A recorded `harness=` is not always an exact adapter name: a task launched from a raw command records that command's basename instead.
`fm_control_harness_family` is the one place that prefix rule is stated, and an unrecognized value resolves to no adapter rather than being guessed into one.

## Verbs

| Verb | Effect | Postcondition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `interrupt` | Deliver the harness's verified interrupt sequence while leaving the agent running. | Delivery succeeds while the endpoint still exists and the agent is still alive where the backend can classify that; cancellation is confirmed only from an adapter-owned acknowledgement and otherwise reports `cancel=unconfirmed`. |
| `exit` | Stop the agent, preserving the endpoint, the worktree, and every uncommitted change. | The backend's recovery-grade classifier reports the agent gone. Already-stopped is idempotent success. |
| `relaunch` | Start a replacement for a running or exited agent in its recorded endpoint and worktree, on the exact recorded adapter or an explicitly chosen harness, model, and effort. | The new agent is alive on the recorded endpoint, and the durable record names the harness that is actually running. |

An exit that delivers lifecycle input but cannot prove the agent stopped fails with `exit=unconfirmed`, reports the observed agent state and any interrupt cancellation claim, and never claims that nothing changed.
Interrupt never rewrites busy state as proof of its own success.
Claude exposes no lifecycle acknowledgement for a manual interrupt, so delivery succeeds with `cancel=unconfirmed` and its adapter-owned busy state remains as observed.
muse's session log records `terminal=cancelled` for the interrupted run, so the control plane reports `cancel=confirmed` only after observing that exact acknowledgement.

An interrupt is not complete until the composer is empty.
muse is the one verified adapter that restores the cancelled prompt back into its composer as real text, so its interrupt key is followed by a Ctrl+U clear; without it the next submitted line - including this plane's own exit command - would concatenate onto the restored prompt and submit both as one line.
The clear is refused before anything is sent when the recorded backend cannot deliver it.

**Teardown and discard are not verbs and will not become verbs.**
`exit` stops an agent and preserves everything else.
Removing a worktree, closing an endpoint, or discarding work stays with [`bin/fm-teardown.sh`](../bin/fm-teardown.sh), which owns the landed-work test.

**`resume` is not a verb.**
It is not deterministic across the verified adapters: codex, grok, and gemini resume only from a session id printed at exit, opencode continues the most recent session for the cwd, and claude, pi, pi-signed, omp, and kimi have no verified pane-resume contract.
`relaunch` covers the same need on every adapter, because the brief on disk - not a harness-private session - is the durable instruction.

## Transactional relaunch

`relaunch` is the only verb that changes durable records, so it runs as a transaction with a journal at `state/<id>.control-relaunch`, the prior record preserved beside it, and a ship or scout's prior instructions preserved when a progress note is appended.
An already registered PR merge poll remains armed and authenticated across relaunch without re-registration; [`bin/fm-pr-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-pr-lib.sh) owns its metadata validation boundary.

1. **Resolve the profile.**
   An explicit `--harness`, `--model`, or `--effort` wins.
   Otherwise a `kind=secondmate` task re-resolves its durable `config/secondmate-harness` pin, including that file's optional model and effort tokens, exactly as every other respawn does - so setting the pin and relaunching is the ordinary way to move a secondmate's runtime.
   A ship or scout keeps the harness already recorded for it, because that harness comes from firstmate's dispatch-profile judgment at intake and must not be silently re-read from configuration.
   A recorded raw-command basename that differs from its resolved adapter cannot reproduce the command actually running, so relaunch refuses before the checkpoint unless the caller passes an explicit `--harness` to choose the replacement runtime deliberately.
   A harness change resets model and effort unless they are named too, because a model chosen for one adapter does not transfer to another.
2. **Safe checkpoint.**
   The recorded worktree must exist and be a worktree root; its head and dirty state are recorded.
   For a `kind=secondmate` task, the home's identity marker must match and its child records must be readable, so a relaunch can never strand child work behind an unreadable home.
   A secondmate's own crewmates run in their own endpoints and outlive its relaunch; the relaunched secondmate reconciles them from its home's durable records at startup.
3. **Record the note.**
   A ship or scout relaunch requires `--note`, because the replacement inherits the local copy but none of the conversation; the note is appended to the instructions it reads.
   A secondmate relaunch does not require one and never rewrites its standing charter.
4. **Prepare the replacement** through its single owner, `bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch`, before stopping the old agent.
   Preparation checks launch configuration, instructions, delivery policy, backlog eligibility, recorded worktree isolation, and workspace trust.
   A recorded Treehouse pool slot must still be claimed by this task (`mine` or `absent`) under the shared project lock before worktree re-entry or stop; that lock is released once re-entry or the live cwd check is confirmed, before the continue-marker wait.
   After stop, the spawn waits for that lock again and proves the claim again before returning the shell into the slot, so a slot reassigned while the agent was stopped refuses the return; the lock is released once re-entry is confirmed.
   Executable resolution uses the pane `HOME`, `PATH`, and recorded worktree.
   An exited shell returns there before those values are captured.
   A live endpoint reads them from the foreground process-group leader only, with native environment entry boundaries preserved.
   A harness executable is selected by its owner resolver on that `PATH`, including the owner's fallback install locations.
   For a direct raw-command relaunch through `fm-spawn.sh`, the explicitly selected executable token is resolved against the pane `HOME`, `PATH`, and worktree.
   Before readiness, `prepare_relaunch` passes the selected executable through that one token resolver and verifies staged hook and plugin files and their destinations.
   It obtains validated retirement paths through `bin/fm-control-lib.sh`, including any Grok or Kimi token sidecar and its resolved registry entry.
   For a secondmate, it also proves inheritance destination access and acquires the required inheritance lock through the shared lock owner, including recovery of abandoned legacy locks; home synchronization and inherited-file publication wait until the old agent has stopped.
   Preparation preserves the previous wiring, active busy generation, and task record.
   Apart from that Treehouse project lock, the same spawn process holds its locks and resolved launch inputs until control authorizes it to continue; the script's header owns this internal handoff.
5. **Stop the old agent** through the `exit` verb, with its postcondition, then release the prepared launch.
   The replacement reuses the recorded endpoint and worktree, retires the previous harness's per-task wiring, publishes the staged wiring, and activates the prepared busy generation where one was armed.
   Kimi's installer reapplies its owned hook region to the current configuration after stop, preserving unrelated edits made during preparation and leaving an unchanged configuration file untouched.

Switching harness is therefore one ordinary relaunch rather than a separate mechanism.

### Failure and rollback

- A refusal **before** the agent is stopped leaves the durable record and the instructions byte-identical.
- A launch failure **after** the agent is stopped restores the prior durable record, keeps the progress note so a later recovery still has it, marks the journal `failed:launching`, and reports plainly that no agent is running and where the work is preserved.
- If the launch owner already published the new record but no running agent can be confirmed, the new record is kept: the task is recorded on the new harness with no agent confirmed, which is exactly what recovery reconciles.
  Rewriting it back to the old harness would be a second, worse inaccuracy.

## Fail-closed boundaries

- Targeting is exact.
  Only a bare task id with a `state/<id>.meta` record in this home is accepted, and that record must pass the shared endpoint-identity validation.
  A legacy `fm-<id>` window label, an explicit `session:window` endpoint, and a record whose `endpoint_task_id` names another task are all refused.
- A remotely placed secondmate is refused by name.
  Its agent runs on another host, so none of the postconditions this plane verifies could be read for it here; local endpoint validation would refuse the record regardless, because `window=remote:<id>` can never match a local backend's required shape.
  Drive that lifecycle on its own host and reconcile it through the secondmate recovery path.
  For `relaunch` that host-side drive is `bin/fm-on.sh <id> fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh relaunch ...`, whose host-local leg runs this same plane against a record that is ordinary and local there, so every checkpoint, journal, rollback, and postcondition below applies unchanged ([`docs/remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md)); `interrupt` and `exit` have no such route.
- An unverified harness is refused rather than guessed at.
- An implicit relaunch from a prefixed raw-command basename is refused before the agent or durable state is touched because its original launch command cannot be reconstructed.
- An adapter that is not verified for this task's kind is refused **before** the running agent is stopped, not after.
  Muse is a crewmate and scout adapter only, so relaunching a secondmate onto it refuses while its agent is still up rather than leaving that secondmate with no agent when the launch owner refuses.
- A backend that cannot deliver the harness's interrupt key, or the composer clear that key needs, is refused rather than sent a different key.
  Orca's terminal API exposes only an interrupt and an Enter, so it can deliver neither Escape nor Ctrl+U.
- `exit` and `relaunch` require a backend with a recovery-grade agent-state classifier - tmux and herdr - because without one the "the agent stopped" postcondition cannot be proven.
  zellij, orca, and cmux are refused rather than reported as successful blind.
- An ambiguous or unreadable endpoint state refuses.
  Only a positively classified state acts.
- `fm-spawn --relaunch` independently requires a positively agent-free endpoint before launch; only control's authorized preparation phase may proceed while the old agent is alive.
  On tmux and Herdr, an agent-free shell outside the recorded worktree receives one `cd` to the validated recorded path and must confirm the move before launch.
  This includes shells that unwound to the home or pool parent after the agent exited.
  A live endpoint outside that path refuses preparation before stop; shell commands are never sent to a live agent.
  The path is checked again after stop because exiting can itself unwind a subshell.
  A later transport or filesystem failure remains a launch failure with an explicit recovery record; preparation cannot guarantee that the environment will remain available.

## Capability matrix

Backend capability comes from each adapter's real surface, not from a policy choice.

| Backend | Escape | Enter | Ctrl+C | Ctrl+U | Recovery-grade agent state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tmux | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| herdr | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| zellij | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| cmux | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| orca | no | yes | yes | no | no |

Per-harness interrupt keys, repeat counts, composer clears, exit commands, and supported task kinds live in `bin/fm-control-lib.sh` and are exercised for every verified harness by `tests/fm-control.test.sh`.
The empirical basis for each adapter's value is the `harness-adapters` skill's verification record for that adapter.

## Verification

- `tests/fm-control.test.sh` - the adapter contract for every verified harness, the backend capability matrix, exact-id scoping, the closed verb list, the busy, idle, dead, and idempotent lifecycle cases, and marker non-regression, all against a stubbed session provider.
- `tests/fm-control-relaunch.test.sh` - the relaunch transaction, preparation refusals, exited-shell recovery, registered merge-poll continuity, and rollback; [runtime verification](verification/runtime-backends.md) records the reusable evidence.
- `tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh` - the second state-verified backend against the real herdr binary, on an isolated throwaway lab session.
