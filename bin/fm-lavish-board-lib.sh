# Verified against lavish-axi 0.1.61. `lavish-axi <file>` EXITS 0 even when it
# refuses to reopen a session the captain ended from the browser, reporting
# `status: user-ended` and the same session id, so an exit-code check alone
# cannot tell a live board from a dead one. The establish status is an initial
# signal only; the server's fresh session listing must also show the canonical
# board open before the build may bind or arm its source.
